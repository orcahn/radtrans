# radtrans

Programming project as part of the lecture 'Computational Methods for the
Interaction of Light and Matter' held in conjunction by Prof. G. Kanschat and
Prof. C. Dullemond at Heidelberg University.

Finite volume (FVM) discretizations of the formal radiative transfer equation by 
the discrete ordinates method with the option of solving a diffusion problem instead
for high albedo values. Lambda iteration is an available preconditioner for the 
linear systems, these being formulated sparsely for efficiency. Multiple interesting
choices of non-constant absorption coefficients. The project is designed to seamlessly
accomodate 1D and 2D problems; Anisotropic mesh sizes are supported in two dimensions.
